# Simple Flask app

This is a simple Flask application. 

Terraform code is for creating EC2 in AWS. You can create a EC2 and then provision the flask app there, or you can build the app localy.

If you want to create the app localy, just do the docker-compose command to start all the containers. 

Inside the app, there are couple of pages, small DB and you can play with adding or deleting things from the DB. Enjoy!
